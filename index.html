      <h2>An exploration of musical preference using Spotify's API</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <p>
          Spotify has tagged songs with different features, such as danceability
          or energy, which we can leverage to shed light on this question. I am
          curious to understand not only what makes songs appealing to the
          majority of the United States population, but also how song features
          are distributed across the world and over time. The evolution of music
          taste is a product of not only our innovative spirit, but also
          cultural and historical influence. Using the data obtained by
          Spotify’s API, we will be able to identify patterns in musical
          preference.

          In order to derive meaning from this chart, you must first understand
          each one of the x axis features. I go through each of them below, but
          more information can be found in Spotify’s documentation web-api
          reference
          <a

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
          <li>
            <b>Danceability</b> describes how suitable a track is for dancing
            based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm
            stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is
            least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Acousticness</b> is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the
            track is acoustic.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Energy</b> is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a
            perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic
            tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Instrumentalness</b> predicts whether a track contains no vocals.
            The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater
            likelihood the track contains no vocal content.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Liveness</b> detects the presence of an audience in the
            recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability
            that the track was performed live.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Speechiness</b> detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
            The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show,
            audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Valence</b> is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical
            positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound
            more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with
            low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Mode</b> indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the
            type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is
            represented by 1 and minor is 0.

        <h2>Popular Features over Time</h2>
        <div id="chart3"></div>
        <div class="container">
          This second graphic depicts the evolution of features over time. Each
          data point in the line graph is the average feature value taken from
          an aggregated 500 songs released in the given year. While there are
          only a few distinct developments, the absence of heavy oscillation is
          a fascinating finding in and of itself. Surprisingly, it doesn’t
          actually look like features of popular music in the United States have
          changed that significantly over time. Even though on the surface it
          might seem like the music people were listening to in the 80s is
          drastically different from what’s on the radio today, the lack of any
          definite trends in this chart suggests that our hidden musical
          preferences are fairly consistent. However, I would like to highlight
          some interesting trends in this data that are consistent with real
          cultural and economic shifts.

        <div class="flex-item">
          <h3>Speechiness Has Increased</h3>
          <p>
            First, notice how speechiness has gradually increased over the last
            30 years. Speechiness is a particularly prominent feature in rap
            songs, where, as the term might suggest, the melody tends to be
            speech-like.
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music#:~:text=Hip%20hop%20became%20a%20best,selling%20music%20genre%20by%201999"
              >Hip hop</a
            >
            became a best-selling genre in the mid-1990s and a top-selling music
            genre in 1999. Since then, its popularity has only continued to
            grow.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
          <h3>Valence Has Decreased</h3>
          <p>
            The second, and perhaps most notable piece of this graph is the
            valence line. As described earlier, valence is a metric that
            describes how happy sounding a given track is. A high valence value
            means that the track sounds more positive, a low valence value means
            that it sounds more negative. Only over the last two decades or so,
            the average valence of the music we consume has dropped
            significantly. Having gone from 0.6 to almost 0.4, this 33% valence
            drop indicates that the music we listen to now sounds much more sad,
            a finding substantiated by an article put out by the Washington
            Post:
            <a
              href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/pop-music-keeps-getting-sadder-and-sadder/2012/05/31/gJQAMAkz4U_blog.html"
              >“Pop music keeps getting sadder and sadder.”</a

          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
          <h3>Liveness Remains Constant</h3>
          <p>
            This chart also sheds light on the manner in which music was
            performed and distributed. The liveness of popular music has
            remained at almost the exact same level since the 80s. This means
            that the proportion of tracks available on Spotify that were
            recorded during a live performance has stayed the same. However, it
            is interesting to note that in 2020 the liveness value
            plummeted—perhaps an effect of COVID. Thanks to the pandemic,
            <a
              href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/this-is-how-covid-19-is-affecting-the-music-industry/"
              >no one was performing live</a
            >
            so it makes sense that the liveness value shot down.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p style="color: #f17b4b">
          <b
            >Why has music gotten more negative? Are we more depressed? Have we
            just come to enjoy sad music more than the lively tracks of the 80s?
            Are artists now making sadder music?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Lower valence music is often correlated with emotional complexity and
          ambivalent feelings. In a paper published by Schellenberg and Scheve,
          they posit that the shift towards sadder sounding songs is linked to
          rising levels of individualization in this modern age. Increasing
          individualization has led to the creation of many subjective
          identities, that are independent of social status, occupation, sex,
          etc. Consequently, the way that one might perceive themselves and the
          way that they are perceived by society is more complicated and
          ambiguous. One might argue that the increase in the number of
          emotional dimensions captured by, and experienced through, popular
          music parallels social and cultural change. If this holds up, it would
          make sense to see an increase in the types of music available. In
          other words, were music to reflect a higher degree of individuality,
          the range music itself would need to expand. But is this true? Is
          popular music more diverse now than it has been? We can answer this
          question with the pie charts below.

            The chart to the right is the genre breakdown in the United States
            in 2020. There are so many more genres and subgenres than I've had
            the space to represent on this graph, including dancehall, easy
            listening, emo, celtic, azonto, and something called adult
            standards. I pared the number of genres down for the sake of
            readability, but the original dataset had more than 100. It is
            interesting to note that hip hop and rap are more popular genres
            today than pop or pop rap.

            The chart to the right is the genre breakdown in the United States
            in 1980. As you can tell, this pie's categories are larger. Even
            though the genres are different than the genres we see in the 2020
            pie, music in the 80s in the United States overall could be divided
            into larger chunks which leads you to believe that in fact, music
            was less variable back in the day. In line with the dicussion above,
            the variety of music available and listened to in the United States
            has expanded significantly.

          In the top row from left to right we have donut genre graphs from

          left to right represent France, Great Britain, Japan, and last but not
          least the United States. It is clear that there are differences across
          each country, although there is also a good deal of unexpected
          overlap. For example, even though the United States is not a Latin
          American country, a good chunk of the popular music in the states
          right now can be categorized as Latin. Similarly , according to
          Spotify’s data,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggaeton">reggaeton</a>, a
          style of music that originated in Panama and is very popular in
          Spanish-speaking countries, is very popular across the globe. Pop, rap
          and hip hop tend to be the consistent winners in every country.

      <h2>My Process</h2>
      <p>
        I am interested in this topic because music is one of my favorite
        things. I grew up surrounded by music and it has only become a bigger
        and bigger part of my life. Although there are many music streaming
        platforms, I opted to use Spotify because it is the one I use and am
        most familiar with. Moreover, it has a robust API and is the most
        popular global streaming platform, followed closely by Apple Music and
        Amazon Music. I was curious to understand what sorts of trends exist
        within Spotify playlists and whether certain types of music are more
        strongly represented on the Spotify platform as a whole. I was also
        interested in characteristics such as the distribution of Spotify
        playlist length, musical trends over time, averaged musical preferences,
        and how my personal music taste fit into this grander picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, using Spotify’s API was more difficult than I had
        anticipated. I leveraged Spotipy for this project which is a lightweight
        Python library for the Spotify Web API. To use Spotipy, I obtained the
        requisite Spotipy_Client_ID (cid) and Spotipy_Client_Secret (secret)
        variables. Setting up my environment was fairly straightforward.
        However, getting the data that I was interested in proved to be a more
        convoluted process. The only way that you can get the features of each
        track is to first find each one’s unique ID. For example, for the first
        graph which characterizes popular spotify playlists based on their
        features, I had to first use the get_playlist api method. This allowed
        me to retrieve all playlists with the desired “toplist” quality, and
        save their corresponding IDs. Using this list of playlist IDs, I then
        used another api method to retrieve all of the songs, and each song’s
        ID, in each one of these playlists. With the song IDs, I was finally
        able to leverage Spotify’s get_audio_features method to obtain the
        feature composition of each song. Taking the average of each feature
        over all of the songs in a given playlist left me with the desired
        dataset: a set of features for the most popular playlists. For the other
        graphs, I went through a similar process where I had to use Spotify’s
        search feature first in order to get IDs, then stick all IDs in a python
        dictionary so as to retain the other variables of interest (year,
        playlist, etc), then use the IDs to get features, then iterate through
        those features to store them in a usable dataframe. Suffice it to say
        this was a much more involved data acquisition process than I’d
        imagined. In addition, because each of these methods requires hundreds
        of API requests, the completion time for this program is fairly slow. I
        wanted as comprehensive of a dataset as I could get, so I chose to max
        out the number of Spotify API calls. For example, for every year between
        1980 and 2020, I requested 950 tracks in hopes that the aggregate data
        will be representative of a given year’s listening trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only was the acquisition of the data a bit complicated, in order to
        create the graphs that I wanted to, I had to reformat the data in
        various different ways. The d3.js documentation that was available
        online was useful insofar as the actual charts were concerned, but I had
        to figure out how to transform my data so that it could be used in the
        desired context. I took advantage of the Pandas package in Python to
        make this easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to include the charts that you see here because I was interested
        in what they would show. I was curious to understand whether there would
        be trends across time and across popular music. The following graphs
        were an effective way to find the answers to these questions. They
        allowed me to gain insight from the copious amounts of dense data I’d
        extracted from Spotify. I also thought that they were fairly easy to
        approachable and wouldn’t overwhelm the viewer. Had I had more time and
        experience, I would have liked to include more information on a given
        graph. For instance, in the first graph that depicts the feature
        compositions of various popular playlists, I wanted the bars to smoothly
        rearrange themselves in order of least to greatest each time the user
        changed the playlist. I struggled with this feature for hours, but
        eventually had to move on because I couldn’t figure out how to
        incorporate multiple transitions. Throughout the course of this project,
        I did feel limited in my knowledge of d3’s interactivity features.

# [Music Analysis](https://sophiahchiang.github.io/music-analysis/)

I would like to use Spotify’s API to better understand the music content that exists on the platform and what people tend to consume. This data oriented project will consist of the following: 
* Learning how to use a Spotify API to scrape data
* Parsing through said data and using it to generate to conclusions. I’m interested in:
  ## Playlists: 
  * I will use Spotify playlists as a vehicle to understand what sorts of trends exist and whether certain types of music are more strongly represented on the platform
  * Features such as Spotify playlist length, the age of featured artists, averaged musical preferences, and how my personal music taste fits into this bigger picture
  * How similar or different are all the songs on the playlist? Can I identify patterns within the Spotify generated playlist that so many of us know and love? 
  ## Songs: 
  * Spotify API provides song characteristics such as liveliness, acoustics, feel, and energy. I would like to use these features to characterize song genre and make other predictions. 
  * For example, given a certain data profile, determine whether a song is “good” or “bad”. This can be done with reference to an outside source such as Fantano or another song/album review site 
  * Predict the type of person that would listen to said song based on associated music. 
  * Predict what other songs Spotify would recommend (i.e. what would be in the song radio?) and see how close I get to the actual recommendations.

Finally I would like to present all of my findings in an appealing way, using html and js to design a final data visualization product.  

# Timeline

The basic timeline I will strive to adhere to to facilitate the execution of this project is as follows: 
* End of week 4: I will have explored Spotify's API and extracted all relevant data. Pulling data will also force me to think through exactly what types of visualizations I want to end up with. 
* End of week 5: I will have used python's data analytic tools to assemble my findings. This includes working with song metric data collected from sources outside of Spotify as well.  
* End of week 6: I will start desiging my visualizations using scalable vector graphics in html and js, and investigate the implementation of interactive elements. 
* End of week 7: Continue working on the website. 
* End of week 8: Finishing touches on website and background algorithms. Submit!
